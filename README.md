## Week 1

### Tasks

- Task 1: Detection metrics.
- Task 2: Detection metrics. Temporal analysis.
- Task 3: Optical flow evaluation metrics.
- Task 4: Visual representation optical flow.

### Execution
Copy the dataset folder into the same folder as this repository.

Execute tasks 1 and 2:
```
python src/main.py
```

Execute tasks 3 and 4:
```
python src/opflows/test.py
```

## Week 2

### Tasks

- Task 1: Gaussian distribution
- Task 2: Recursive Gaussian modeling
- Task 3: Compare with state-of-the-art
- Task 4: Color sequences

### Execution
Copy the dataset folder into the same folder as this repository.

Execute task1:
```
python src/main.py --general_config detector.alpha=4 detector.rho=0

```

Execute task 2:
```
python src/main.py --general_config detector.alpha=5 detector.rho=0.01
```
Gridsearch
Change parameters of grid search inside grid_search.py
```
python src/grid_search.py
```

Execute task 3:
```
python src/main.py --general_config detector.type="gauss_black_rem"
```
Detectors: ["color_gauss_black_rem","gauss_black_rem", "MOG", "MOG2", "CNT", "GMG", "LSBP", "GSOC"]

Execute task 4:
Change Color space inside main.py file
```
python src/main.py 
```
## Week 3

### Tasks

- Task 1: Object detection
    - Task 1.1: Object Detection: Off-the-Shelf
    - Task 1.2: Object Detection: Fine-tuned model
    
- Task 2: Object tracking
    - Task 2.1: Tracking by maximum overlap
    - Task 2.2: Tracking with a Kalman filter
    - Task 2.3: IDF1 for Multiple Object Tracking
 
 ### Execution
 Copy the dataset folder into the same folder as this repository.
 
All the tasks can be executed using the following command:
```
python src/main.py 
```
The parameters that can be modified can be found on the src/config/general.py file. The values for that parameters can be modified using a command in the terminal. For example, to run a task with a different value for the parameter weights_path we can use:
```
python src/main.py --general_config detector.weights_path="../new_folder/detectron.weights"
```
## Week 4

###Tasks

- Task 1: Optical Flow
    - Task 1.1: Optical Flow with Block Matching
    - Task 1.2: Off-the-shelf Optical Flow
- Task 2: Video Stabilization
    - Task 2.1: Video Stabilization with Block Matching
    - Task 2.2: Off-the-shelf Video Stabilization
- Task 3: Object Tracking
    - Task 3.1: Object Tracking with Optical Flow

### Execution
Copy the dataset into the same folder as this repository.

#### Task 1

All the methods used in task 1 can be tested by changing the sel_method index to the one of the desired method from the src/opflows/test.py file. Then we can just execute the test.py file. 

#### Task 2



The first off-the-shelf method for video stabilization, the one based on OpenCV, can be executed using the following command:

```
python src/scripts/video_stabilizer.py
```

However, it might be interesting to enter the file and change the path to the videos we are working on.

The other off-the-shelf method for video stabilization, the Kamran Video Stabilizer, is implemented on Matlab and need to be executed from there. It can be executed using the main.m file located on src/scripts/Kamran_video_stabilizer/main.m.

#### Task 3

To execute task 3 you can just execute the main.py file or just execute the following command on the terminal:

```
python src/main.py --general_config tracker.ttype = "optical_flow_track"
```
